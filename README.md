Source code for the bot hosted at: https://poe.com/Vicuna-13B-V13

This is an an implementation of Nous-Hermes-Llama-2-13B using the [Poe-Protocol](https://developer.poe.com/api-bots/poe-protocol-specification). In order to run this yourself, [setup modal](https://modal.com/docs/guide#getting-started), setup a secret on modal.com with your Poe security key and your Together API Key, rename the secret in main.py and then run `modal serve main.py`. The command will deploy this app and output a url. Use that url to create a poe bot at: https://poe.com/create_bot?api=1
